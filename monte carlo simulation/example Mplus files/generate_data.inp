Example Mplus Input File Used to Generate 
Population Data Using the Doubly Latent Model

montecarlo:
seed = 123;
names = x1-x4; !4 observed indicators at L1
ncsizes = 1;
csizes = 100(100); !100 clusters of size 100
nobservations = 10000; 
nreps = 10; !example for 10 replications 
repsave = all;
save = rep*.dat;

model population:
%within%
x1-x4*22.8; !L1 residual variance of indicators 
Factor_w BY x1-x4*1; !L1 factor loadings
Factor_w*1; !L1 factor variance 
[Factor_w*0]; !L1 factor mean

%between%
x1-x4*1.2; !L2 residual variance of indicators 
Factor_b BY x1-x4*1; !L2 factor loadings
Factor_b*1; !L2 factor variance 
[Factor_b*0]; !L2 factor mean

analysis:
