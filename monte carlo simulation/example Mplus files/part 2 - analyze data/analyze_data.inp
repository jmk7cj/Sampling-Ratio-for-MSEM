Example Mplus Input File Used to Analyze Analytic 
Sample Datasets Using the Doubly Latent Model

data:
type = montecarlo; 
file = part2_replist.txt; !name of textfile containing names of 
                          !each analytic sample dataset, sampled 
                          !according to SR=0.20
variable:
names = x1-x4 schid; 
cluster = schid;                             

model: 
%within%
x1-x4*22.8; 
Factor_w BY x1*1(1) !Constrain factor loadings to be invariant across levels
x2*1(2)
x3*1(3)
x4*1(4); 
Factor_w@1; ! L1 factor variance constrained for identification


%between%
x1-x4*1.2; 
Factor_b BY x1*1(1) !Cross-level invariance
x2*1(2)
x3*1(3)
x4*1(4); 

Factor_b*1; ! L2 factor variance freely estimated

analysis:
type = twolevel;
estimator = mlr;
